# Contributing

We're so pleased you want to contribute. That's what makes the Open Source community awesome!

Here are a couple of rules we expect you to follow:

- All contributed code should have supporting unit tests
- Breaking changes should be highlighted so that we can properly version them
- Tell us why your addition to the library is useful, share your vision!
- Have fun
